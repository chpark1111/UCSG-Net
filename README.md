UCSGNet: Unsupervised Discovering of Constructive Solid Geometry Tree [PaperLink](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09102)  

Used author codes: Data loader, visualizer

TimeLine:  
5/5 ∼ 5/19: Implement data generator, encoder, decoder, shapeeval, converter   
5/19 ∼ 5/26: Implement rest of the model, utility functions(i.e. loss, gumbelsoftmax, etc)  
5/26 ~ 6/3: Establish whole pipline and test, visualize them  
6/3 ∼ 6/6: Make reports, poster, organize codes
